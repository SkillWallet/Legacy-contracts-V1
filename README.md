# Overview
The SkillWallet is a standard for universal, self-sovereign Identity as an NFT.<br/>
In order to receive it and activate individuals need to be member of a Community. By being part of a Community, they can participate Gigs/Tasks/Projects, that in return provide them Credits (DITO), that they can spend across the whole network, partners included.<br/>
Once an individual member's skills are validated (through Gigs), they will be able to spend their Credits, create new tasks/projects, and move to a different Community seamlessly, without losing the Credits & the reputation earned.

## Steps
Whenever new users start to create a new account, they are prompted to:
- select their main role or skills, plus a nickname and avatar
- based on their Skills selection, they can pick the Community they want to join
- these selections constitue the Metadata of their NFT ID, so that any Identity is initiated within a Community
- once the new SkillWallet ID is initiated, Chainlink Verifiable Random Function generates a unique hash that is added to the SkillWalletRegistry contract
- during the process, the new NFT ID is initially inactive, so the same VRF hash is used to generate a QR-code pattern, that is verifiably unique, and cannot be anyhow re-used or counterfaited
- at this point, new users will just download our SkillWallet Mobile App, and scan the QR-Code on the Web App.
- Finally, our Chainlink External Adapter will verify this action, and in just in 1 step, users new ID will be activated and they will receive their personal NFT ID â€“ and own, de-facto, their universal, non-transferable, self-sovereign identity!
